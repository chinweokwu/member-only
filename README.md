# members-only

TMembers can post public messages, but only members can see who posted the messages!  
This Rails project utilizes a 'roll-your-own' authentication system and a bootstrapped (mostly) responsive design.

## Installing
This deploys easily, as a fairly simple Rails app with limited dependencies.  
Just remember to run `rails db:seed` after `rails db:migrate`, in order to have a few initial members to work with!
